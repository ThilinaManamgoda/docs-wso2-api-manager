<strong>Warning: </strong>
The WSO2 API Manager for PCF tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation
and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.
</p>

This documentation describes WSO2 API Manager Installer for Pivotal Cloud
Foundry (PCF), which installs the API management service
[WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0](https://wso2.com/api-management/) on PCF. WSO2 API Manager
Tile provides full lifecycle API development, integration, and management.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

WSO2 API Manager is a unique, open approach to full lifecycle API development, integration, and
management. It allows extensibility and customization, and ensures freedom from lock-in. As part of
the larger WSO2 Integration Agile Platform, it is a central component used to deploy and manage
API-driven ecosystems. Itâ€™s hybrid integration capabilities further simplify projects that span
traditional as well as micro-service environments.

The Deployment Architecture for API Manager is as follows:

## <a id='key-components'></a>Key Components

#### API Publisher

API development is usually done by someone who understands the technical aspects of the API, interfaces, documentation, versions etc., while API management is typically carried out by someone who understands the business aspects of the APIs. In most business environments, API development is a responsibility that is distinct from API publication and management.
WSO2 API Manager provides a simple Web interface called WSO2 API Publisher for API development and management. It is a structured GUI designed for API creators to develop, document, scale and version APIs, while also facilitating more API management-related tasks such as publishing API, monetization, analyzing statistics, and promoting.

#### API Store

The API Store Web application provides a collaborative interface for API publishers to host and advertise their APIs and for API consumers to [self register](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Customizing+the+API+Store), discover, evaluate, subscribe to and use secured, protected, authenticated APIs.

#### API Gateway

A runtime, backend component (an [API proxy](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+APIs)) developed using [WSO2 ESB](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/WSO2+Enterprise+Integrator+Documentation). API Gateway secures, protects, manages, and scales API calls. It intercepts API requests, applies policies such as throttling and security using handlers, and manages API statistics.
Upon validation of a policy, the Gateway passes web service calls to the actual backend. If the service call is a token request, the Gateway passes it directly to the [Key Manager](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Key+Concepts#KeyConcepts-KeyManager).
This component is horizontally scalable, it is possible to scale up to 20 gateway nodes.

#### Key Manager

Manages all clients, security and access token-related operations. The Gateway connects with the Key Manager to check the validity of [OAuth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) tokens, subscriptions and API invocations. When a subscriber creates an application and generates an access token to the application using the API Store, the Store makes a call to the API Gateway, which in turn connects with the Key Manager to create an OAuth client and obtain an access token. Similarly, to validate a token, the API Gateway calls the Key Manager, which fetches and validates the token details from the database.
This component is horizontally scalable.

#### Traffic Manager

The Traffic Manager helps users to regulate API traffic, make APIs and applications available to consumers at different service levels, and secure APIs against security attacks. The Traffic Manager features a dynamic throttling engine to process throttling policies in real-time, including rate limiting of API requests.
For more information, see [Working with Throttling](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/Working+with+Throttling). Note that Traffic Managers do not scale horizontally.

#### Analytics

Additionally, monitoring and analytics are provided by the analytics component, WSO2 API Manager Analytics. This component provides a host of statistical graphs, an alerting mechanism on pre-determined events and a log analyzer. For more information, see [Analytics](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/Analytics).
